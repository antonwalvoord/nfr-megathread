>This website is meant to serve as a supplement to the team's [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1boavSifWlNr12e1p5JiLdDr9w4vJpjsj). While the Drive hosts the vast majority of low level detail regarding projects, this is meant to be a knowledge base of high level information, including: rules, car architecture, terminology, software setup and usage guides, and information about the team itself. Reference the usage tips below for more information on navigating the site.
