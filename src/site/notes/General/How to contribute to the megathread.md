# Software

### ==Obsidian==
#### Plugins
##### Git
In order to make sure everyone is operating off of a shared version we use Git for version control. Obsidian has a great plugin for this which makes it incredibly easy to stay in sync with the repo.
- If you don't have Git installed on your computer, reference [this guide](https://nfr-learn.ue.r.appspot.com/lessons/4/3/) steps **4 and 5**
- Go to the [Git](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-git) plugin page, install and enable it
- Follow [this guide](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Getting+Started) to fully set up the plugin
- When you clone the repository you should use [this] link
- When using this plugin, the most useful command is "commit-and-sync". In order to use this command, use ctrl/cmd+p and type in "Git: Commit-and-sync"
##### Digital Garden
If you want to be able to publish to the site yourself you'll need this plugin, otherwise someone else with the plugin will need to pull from github and then publish
- Go to the [Digital Garden](obsidian://show-plugin?id=digitalgarden) plugin page, install and enable it
- You need to create an access token to your GitHub Account. This acts as a sort of password so that the plugin can add new notes to your GitHub repository on your behalf. Go to [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo) while logged in to GitHub. The correct settings should already be applied. (If you don't want to generate this every few months, choose the "No expiration" option.) Click the "Generate token" button, and copy the token you are presented with on the next page.
- Open Obsidian and the settings for "Digital Garden" and fill in your GitHub username, the name of the repo (nfr-megathread), and lastly paste in your token.
- Now you can publish to the site!
