# About:
Battery management systems are mainly boards that monitors specific elements of the accumulator (another word for very big battery) and determine the state of operation of the accumulator, which depends on both the internal circumstances of the accumulator as well as external circumstances of the rest of the car. 
There are several boards within this project group, which can be found in the [[Electrical/BMS/Battery Management System Home#Project List\|#Project List]] down below.
